=== JOB MATCH EVALUATION ===

You are evaluating if a job matches the candidate profile.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: Follow the EVALUATION STEPS section below step-by-step. Stop at the first failed check.**

**OUTPUT FORMAT (MUST FOLLOW):**

If suitable:
Yes

If NOT suitable:
No
Reason: [Brief reason from the step that failed]

---

**CORE PRINCIPLE:**

Candidate: Java backend developer, 2 years experience
Goal: Apply to Java backend jobs in large companies (500+ employees)
Approach: Follow the 7-step checklist below - if ANY step fails, REJECT immediately with the reason from that step

---

**CRITICAL DEAL-BREAKERS (REJECT ONLY FOR THESE):**

1. **Wrong Role Type:**
   - Frontend roles (React, Angular, Vue developer)
   - Full-stack roles (requires both frontend AND backend)
   - UI/UX designer
   - DevOps/SRE focused roles (primary focus on infrastructure, not development)
   - Data Science/ML Engineer (primary focus on ML, not backend development)

2. **Wrong Primary Language:**
   - Primary language is NOT Java (Python, Node.js, Go, .NET, PHP, Ruby, etc.)
   - Note: "Primary language" means the main language for the role, not just mentioned in passing

3. **Experience Mismatch:**
   - Requires 5+ years of experience
   - Explicitly requires "Senior" or "Lead" level with people management/mentoring
   - Entry-level/internship requiring 0 years (candidate has 2 years)

4. **Company Size:**
   - Company has < 500 employees (STRICT requirement)
   - Startup/small company (unless explicitly stated 500+ employees)

5. **Location/Timezone:**
   - Job location outside India (unless explicitly remote with IST/India hours)
   - Requires US/EU/night shift timings
   - Requires international relocation

6. **Job Type:**
   - Part-time positions
   - Contract/Freelance positions (reject unless it's full-time contract-to-hire)
   - Internships

7. **Impossible Skill Requirements:**
   - Requires MANDATORY skills in technologies candidate has ZERO experience in AND are core to the role
   - Example: "Must have 2+ years Golang" - reject (different language)
   - Example: "Must have Docker/Kubernetes" - still ACCEPT (these are deployment tools, candidate can learn)

---

---

**IMPORTANT: MANDATORY vs OPTIONAL SKILLS**

ONLY reject for missing MANDATORY skills that are CORE to the job AND the candidate has NO relevant experience.

**MANDATORY** skills use words like:
- "Required", "Must have", "Should have", "Need"
- Listed under "Requirements", "Qualifications", "Must-haves"

**OPTIONAL** skills use phrases like:
- "Plus", "Bonus", "Nice to have", "Preferred", "Good to have"
- "Familiarity with", "Exposure to", "Advantageous", "Desirable"
- "Knowledge of... is a plus"

**SKILL EVALUATION LOGIC:**

1. **Ignore optional skills completely** - Don't even consider them
2. **For mandatory skills:**
   - Core Java/Backend skills: Candidate HAS this ✅
   - Similar technologies: ACCEPT (e.g., knows MySQL → can work with PostgreSQL)
   - Learnable tools: ACCEPT (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD - these can be learned on the job)
   - Different language/platform: REJECT (e.g., Python/Django, Node.js, .NET)

**Examples:**
- "Required: Java, Spring Boot" → ACCEPT (candidate has both)
- "Required: Java, Hibernate" → ACCEPT (candidate has JPA/Hibernate experience)
- "Required: Java, PostgreSQL" → ACCEPT (candidate has MySQL, can easily work with PostgreSQL)
- "Required: Java, Docker, Kubernetes" → ACCEPT (Java is core skill, Docker/K8s can be learned)
- "Required: Python, Django" → REJECT (different language stack)
- "Required: Java, React" → REJECT (full-stack role)

---

**EVALUATION STEPS - FOLLOW EXACTLY IN THIS ORDER:**

YOU MUST CHECK THESE IN ORDER. STOP AT FIRST FAILURE.

**STEP 1: Company Size (MOST IMPORTANT - CHECK FIRST!)**
Question: Does the job description explicitly mention company size OR company name with 500+ employees?
- If YES and 500+ employees → Continue to Step 2
- If NO or size not mentioned or unknown company → REJECT with "Company size not mentioned or < 500 employees"
- CRITICAL: If job says "client's company" or doesn't name the company → REJECT

**STEP 2: Job Type Check**
Question: Is this a full-time position?
- If YES (full-time) → Continue to Step 3
- If NO (part-time/contract/internship) → REJECT with "Part-time/Contract/Internship position"

**STEP 3: Role Type Check**
Question: Is this a pure backend development role OR software engineering role?
- If YES (backend/software engineer) → Continue to Step 4
- If NO (frontend/full-stack/DevOps/Data Science/QA/ETL Data Engineer) → REJECT with appropriate reason
- Note: "ETL Developer", "DataStage Developer", "Data Pipeline Engineer" are DATA ENGINEER roles → REJECT with "Data Engineering role, not backend development"

**STEP 4: Primary Language Check**
Question: Is Java the primary programming language for this role?
- If YES (Java mentioned as main skill) → Continue to Step 5
- If NO (Python/Node.js/Go/.NET as primary) → REJECT with "Primary language is [X], not Java"

**STEP 5: Experience Level Check**
Question: Does the job require 0-4 years of experience?
- If YES (0-4 years) → Continue to Step 6
- If NO (5+ years or Senior/Lead with management) → REJECT with "Requires 5+ years experience" or "Senior/Lead position"

**STEP 6: Location/Timezone Check**
Question: Is the job in India OR Remote (India/IST hours)?
- If YES → Continue to Step 7
- If NO (international/US-EU shift) → REJECT with "Location outside India" or "US/EU timezone required"

**STEP 7: All Checks Passed**
→ Answer "Yes"

---

**REASON FORMAT (Be specific but brief):**

Good reasons:
- "Primary language is Python, not Java"
- "Full-stack role requiring React and Java"
- "Requires 6 years of experience"
- "Company size < 500 employees"
- "Requires US timezone/night shift"
- "Frontend role"
- "Part-time position"
- "DevOps role, not backend development"

Bad reasons (too restrictive - DON'T use):
- "No mention of Spring Boot" ❌
- "Doesn't mention REST APIs" ❌
- "Requires Docker" ❌
- "Missing Kubernetes experience" ❌

---

**OPTIONAL SKILL INDICATORS (IGNORE THESE):**

These phrases mean the skill is NOT mandatory - DO NOT reject for missing these:
- "is a plus", "is a bonus"
- "nice to have", "good to have"
- "preferred", "desirable"
- "familiarity with", "exposure to"
- "knowledge of... would be advantageous/beneficial"
- "experience with... is welcomed"

Example: "Experience in Scala is a plus" → IGNORE Scala completely
Example: "Docker/Kubernetes preferred" → IGNORE Docker/Kubernetes completely

4. **Output Format:**
   - First line MUST be "Yes" or "No"
   - If "No", second line MUST be "Reason: [exact reason from failed step]"

5. **Be Inclusive for Skills, Strict for Deal-breakers:**
   - IGNORE all optional skills completely
   - ACCEPT if candidate has core Java backend skills
   - Be STRICT on: company size, role type, primary language, experience level, location

6. **Context Notes:**
   - Bangalore and Bengaluru are the same city
   - "Software Engineer", "SDE", "Backend Engineer" are all acceptable role titles
   - Java 8/11/17/21 are all just "Java"
   - Spring, Spring Boot, Spring Framework are all acceptable
