**FORMAT CONTROL:**

**NUMERIC FORMAT:**

Return ONLY a number. Nothing else.

**For direct questions:**

Options: {{OPTIONS_LIST}}

Options will be provided as a list. Return the 0-based index of the correct option.

**Selection logic:**
- Exact match in profile → Select that index

- Not in profile → Select "No"/"None"/lowest option
- For YES/NO: Profile says YES → Select YES index, otherwise NO index
- For proficiency: Expert skills → High index, Basic → Low index, Not listed → Lowest index
